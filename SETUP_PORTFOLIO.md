# Portfolio Setup Guide

## ✅ Issues Fixed

1. **404 Error on `/admin/portfolio/new`** - Fixed by adding the missing route
2. **Missing Portfolio Creation Component** - Created `admin-portfolio-new.tsx`
3. **Public Portfolio Display** - Created public portfolio page at `/portfolio`
4. **TypeScript Errors** - Fixed all admin component typing issues

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create Admin User

First, create an admin user in the database:

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed-admin
```

This will create an admin user with:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`
- **Email:** `admin@materix.com`

### 2. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access Admin Panel

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/admin/login`
2. Login with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`
3. You'll be redirected to the admin dashboard

### 5. Create Portfolio Items

1. In the admin dashboard, click "Add Portfolio Item"
2. Fill out the form with your project details
3. Set status to "published" to make it visible on the public portfolio
4. Click "Create Portfolio Item"

### 6. View Public Portfolio

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/portfolio` to see your published portfolio items
2. Or click "View Portfolio" on the home page

1. Make sure items are set to "published" status
2. Check the browser console for API errors
3. Verify the backend API is responding correctly
